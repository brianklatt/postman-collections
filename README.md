# postman-collections

This repository is a collection of example queries for the Pivotal Tracker v5 API formatted for the Postman rest client.

You can get Postman as a Chrome extension from

  http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fshoptotrot.com&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHjAhrpTYe6Jy78Dk1NFRLDrHAk6A

or as a packaged app from

  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client-packa/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop

Once you're in Postman (either the Chrome extension or the packaged app), import the collection by:

1.  Click Import.
2.  Choose Tracker-v5-API-examples.json.postman_collection from where ever you cloned this repository.
3.  Either import as a new collection or overwrite an existing collection.

Postman is well documented, so please refer to the Postman documentation for instructions on how to use collections.

We have also provided a sample environment, which includes sample values for variables in the queries.

To import the sample environment, go to Manage Environments in Postman and import the environment.
